# Real Estate Platform Demo

A real estate platform built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies. This project serves as a demonstration of full-stack development capabilities for test automation practices.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aviv-public/aviv-qa-technical-test.git
cd aviv-qa-technical-test
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ§ª Test Automation

### Decision to Use Playwright

We chose Playwright for the following reasons:
- **Cross-browser testing**: Playwright supports testing across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
- **Parallel execution**: Playwright allows running tests in parallel, which speeds up the test execution process.
- **Rich API**: Playwright provides a rich set of APIs for interacting with web elements, making it easier to write robust tests.
- **Built-in test runner**: Playwright comes with a built-in test runner that supports features like retries, tracing, and more.

### Data-Driven Approach

We implemented a data-driven approach to separate test data from test logic. Test data is stored in JSON files, which allows us to:
- **Easily manage test data**: Test data can be updated without modifying the test code.
- **Run tests with multiple data sets**: Tests can be parameterized to run with different sets of data.
- **Maintain test data separately**: Keeping test data separate from test logic improves test maintainability.

### Locators

We added data-test-ids to the source code to make it easier to locate elements in the tests. This ensures that tests are more robust and less likely to break due to changes in the UI.

### Allure Results and Publishing

We integrated Allure for test reporting. Allure provides detailed test execution results, including screenshots and video captures. The Allure report is generated and published to GitHub Pages after each test run.

### Parallel Run

We configured Playwright to run tests in parallel to speed up the test execution process. This is especially useful for large test suites.

### Executing Tests and Viewing Results

1. **Run Tests**
   To run the tests, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run test:allure
   ```

   To run the tests with Playwright UI, use the following command
   ```bash
   npx pw:open
   ```

   To run the tests without UI, use the following command
   ```bash
   npx pw:run
   ```


2. **View Allure Report**
   After the tests have run, the Allure report is generated and published to GitHub Pages. You can view the report at:
   [Allure Report](https://desperado.github.io/aviv-qa-technical-test/)

## ðŸ§ª Submitting Tests

QA Engineers, responsible for ensuring the quality and functionality of the API, should follow test automation best practices including:

#### Page Object Pattern
- Implement Page Object Model (POM) to create an object repository for web UI elements
- Each page should have its corresponding page class
- Maintain separation between test methods and page specific code
- Group related elements and actions within relevant page objects

#### Data-Driven Testing
- Externalize test data in JSON/YAML files
- Parameterize tests to run with multiple data sets
- Maintain test data separate from test logic
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios

#### Test scenarios that need to be implemented
- Implement test cases for user registration, login, and logout
- Test user roles and permissions (Admin, Agent, User)
- Verify user profile management functionality
- Test property listing and search functionality
- Validate property details and booking process
- Verify user notifications and alerts

#### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% test coverage for critical paths
- Test all user roles (Admin, Agent, User)

#### Technical Stack
- Test Automation Frameworks:
    - Choose one of the following:
        - Selenium WebDriver (Java/Python/JavaScript)
        - WebDriver.IO (JavaScript/TypeScript)
        - Cypress (JavaScript/TypeScript)
        - Playwright (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Continuous Integration:
    - GitHub Actions for automated test execution
    - Parallel test execution
    - Scheduled test runs
- Test Reporting:
    - Allure Reports integration
    - Detailed test execution results
    - Screenshots and video captures

### Contribution Steps
1. **Fork the repository:**
    Go to the repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone your forked repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/aviv-qa-technical-test.git
    cd aviv-qa-technical-test
    ```

3. **Create a new branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b test-branch-name
    ```

4. **Add your test cases:**
    Add your test cases in the `tests` directory.

5. **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add test cases"
    ```

6. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow:**
    In the root of your repository, create a directory named `.github/workflows` if it doesn't already exist. Inside this directory, create a file named `ci.yml`.

7. **Push your branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin test-branch-name
    ```

8. **Create a pull request:**
    Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request to merge your test branch into the main branch.
